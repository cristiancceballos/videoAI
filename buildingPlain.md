     - RLS policies for multi-tenant security

  3. Expo App Setup
     - Initialize with latest Expo SDK
     - Configure Supabase client with environment variables
     - Basic navigation structure

  4. Auth Flow
     - Login/signup screens
     - Protected route wrapper
     - Session management

  Phase 2: Video Upload & Storage üé•

  1. Upload Infrastructure
     - Presigned URL generation for direct Supabase Storage upload
     - Support for device picker (expo-document-picker)
     - URL paste functionality for YouTube/TikTok links
     - Thumbnail generation and upload

  2. Video Processing Queue
     - Supabase Edge Function for upload webhook
     - Queue job creation for background processing
     - Status tracking (uploading ‚Üí processing ‚Üí ready)

  3. Basic Video Feed
     - Grid layout matching your design
     - Video cards with thumbnails, titles, status chips
     - Pull-to-refresh functionality

  Phase 3: AI Processing Pipeline ü§ñ

  1. Audio Extraction & Transcription
     - Supabase Queue worker with ffmpeg for audio extraction
     - Whisper API integration for transcription
     - Error handling and retry logic

  2. AI Summarization
     - Edge Function with GPT-4 Turbo/Claude integration
     - Prompt engineering for concise summaries
     - Real-time status updates via Supabase Realtime

  3. Vector Embeddings
     - Chunk transcripts into semantic segments
     - Generate embeddings (OpenAI/Cohere)
     - Store in pgvector for similarity search

  Phase 4: Interactive UI & Q&A üí¨

  1. Swipe-Up Sheet (Bottom Sheet)
     - React Native gesture handler implementation
     - Summary display with markdown support
     - Q&A chat interface

  2. RAG-Powered Chat
     - Embed user questions
     - pgvector similarity search for relevant chunks
     - Context-aware GPT responses with source attribution

  3. Notes System
     - Markdown editor for user notes
     - Real-time sync with Supabase
     - Integration with video timeline (future enhancement)

  Phase 5: Search & Discovery üîç

  1. Hybrid Search
     - Full-text search on titles/notes (ILIKE/tsvector)
     - Vector similarity search on content
     - Combined ranking algorithm

  2. Search UI
     - Global search bar in header
     - Filter options (date, category, status)
     - Search result highlighting

  Phase 6: Polish & Production ‚ú®

  1. Error Handling
     - Retry mechanisms for failed processing
     - User-friendly error states and messages
     - Offline capability considerations

  2. Performance & Limits
     - Rate limiting (uploads per user/day)
     - Background processing optimization
     - Caching strategies

  3. Notifications
     - Push notifications when processing completes
     - In-app status updates

  4. Analytics & Monitoring
     - Usage tracking
     - Error monitoring
     - Performance metrics

  Technical Stack Confirmation:

  - Frontend: Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Expo for Web
  - Deployment: QR code distribution via web hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
  - Backend: Supabase (Auth, Storage, Postgres+pgvector, Edge Functions, Queues)
  - AI: OpenAI (Whisper, GPT-4, Embeddings)
  - Video Processing: ffmpeg in Supabase Edge Functions
  - Real-time: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
  - Media Handling: HTML5 File API and XMLHttpRequest for uploads

  Your PWA approach is excellent - direct distribution via QR code eliminates app store 
  complexity while providing native-like experience. The presigned URL upload, background 
  queue processing, and RAG implementation are all industry best practices. Perfect for 
  small user base (<10 users) with immediate updates and cross-platform compatibility.
